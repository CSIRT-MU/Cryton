It was designed as such to assist red teams in cybersecurity exercises in means of repeatability of attack scenarios. These scenarios are often prepared in advance and reflect vulnerabilities hidden in the blue team's infrastructure.</p> <p>Imagine you are taking part in a cyber defense exercise as a tutor. The task for your trainees is to defend a system or a whole infrastructure (which you prepared) against an attacker. This system is full of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations (which you prepared as well). Your trainees have one hour to fix as many of these issues as possible. Imagine you have to check each system for all the fixes to see how your trainees managed to succeed. How would you do that effectively?</p> <p>This is where Cryton comes into play. If you know all the vulnerabilities in the trainees' system - and you do - you can prepare an attack scenario to check if they are still available and working after the fix. Cryton will execute the plan against all targets you tell it to and then generate reports (human and machine-readable). You can then not only see, which attack steps did succeed on which system, but also score your trainees based on these results.</p> <p>With this in mind, you should not expect Cryton to be an evil artificial intelligence capable of taking over the world. It is simply a scheduler for Python modules. The scheduler executes these modules according to some execution tree with conditions based on each step of the scenario. Each module is a script orchestrating some well-known attack tools, but that is it.</p>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>Cryton is tested and targeted primarily on Debian and Kali Linux. However, it should be possible to use it everywhere if the requirements are met. Please keep in mind that only the latest version is supported and issues regarding different OS or distributions may not be resolved.</p> <p>Using Docker should render the support limitations irrelevant.</p>"},{"location":"#changelog","title":"Changelog","text":"<p>The releases and their changes can be found on the official Gitlab</p> <ul> <li>Cryton release page</li> <li>Frontend release page</li> </ul>"},{"location":"acknowledgements/","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p>Several research activities helped us to create this open-source project.

Using the Django REST framework for the REST interface also emerged from this choice.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/#rabbit-mq","title":"Rabbit MQ","text":"<p>For developing Master-Worker architecture, where you can issue commands remotely, we needed some kind of RPC.

That's why we chose a messaging broker RabbitMQ.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/#metasploit","title":"Metasploit","text":"<p>I guess everyone in the IT security field has heard about the Metasploit framework. It is one of the most complete and usable open-source attack tools available. Of course, Cryton uses it for some attack modules - the majority of simulated attacks in CDXs usually do use Metasploit in some way. But its attacking capabilities are not the only reason to use it. Its real advantage is Metasploit's session management. Every time you open a session to some machine it stores it under a specific ID which you can later use to communicate with the target. This is one of the main features you can use while executing your attack scenario in Cryton.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/#empire","title":"Empire","text":"<p>For post-exploitation attacks, we decided to add support for an open-source project called Empire (version 4.10.0), which is a post-exploitation framework that includes pure-PowerShell Windows agents, Python 3 Linux/OS X agents, and C# agents.
